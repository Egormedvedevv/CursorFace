# CursorFace
A completely unnecessary, slightly creepy site where characters silently stare at your cursor. Enjoy the weird.
---
CursorFace is a small experimental website where funny characters follow your mouse cursor.  
You can choose one of 6 characters and watch their eyes react to your movements.
